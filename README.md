(Describe design pattern used)

### Week 2
Created issues and the project board. (include screenshot)

### Week 3
We worked on the customer class and testing the functions. We also created the menu interface and developed an initial schema for the database.

### Week 4
We implemented the customer functions and the phone class. We also set up google test for unit testing.

### Week 5
We plan to work on rapidJson technology. We want to learn more about it so we can implement our database system to interact with json files and store them even when the program stops running.

### Week 6

We are having a few setbacks due to conflicting schedules so we are a bit behind schedule but the plan is to catch up on the work for this week and get rapidjson up and working with the main code.
